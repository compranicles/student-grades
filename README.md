# student-grades
 

## Machine Problem

Within computer programming, the acronym CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Using the CRUD approach, create an application to manage students together with their grades in different subjects.

Pointers:
• Application must have a landing page for student’s log-inand a button below for accessing teachers log-in.
• Student after log-in will be direct to a page where he/she can see his/her latest semester grades in different subjects/teachers.
• Create a Static 4 semester.
• Teachers after log-in direct to a view where he/she can see all of his/her students. 
• Beside every student data must have an action button where the teacher can insert grades for the selected semester. 
• He/she can also update the grades already there or delete it.
• Also create in their specific log-in page a button for registration.
• All students that's register will be enlist to all registered teachers and for the new teacher that will be register in teacher’s log-in page registration.

Reminder: This is a basic CRUD, no need to create student section or year. Let say the all student that will register in your app is 1st Year Diamond. Only use PHP in this machine problem. You can use native/vanilla way or framework within this two preferred framework(laravel/codeigniter). Lastly, if you upload it to GIT make sure to make a step on how to make your app work after we pull it. Same for those who send it via .rar. Kindly focus on the back end not on the front end design.
